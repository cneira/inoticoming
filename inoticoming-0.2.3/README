inoticoming is a daemon to watch a directory with Linux's inotify
framework and trigger actions once files with specific names are placed
in there.
For example it can be used to wait for .changes files uploaded
into a directory and call reprepro to put them into your repository.
For more information please have a look at its manpage.
